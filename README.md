## Introduction
This repository has released the training and test set of KINS. The annotation format follows COCO style. The mask can be decoded by COCOAPI.

And the reference code of the method in CVPR 2019 paper '[Amodal Instance Segmentation through KINS Dataset](http://jiaya.me/papers/amodel_cvpr19.pdf)' has been released. The codebase is based on [pytorch-detectron](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/Detectron.pytorch).
You can see some details from our released code. I am sorry that I can not transform it into the maskrcnn-benchmark with clear version.
